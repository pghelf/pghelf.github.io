      <p> Here is where you can learn more about me! </p>
    </div>
     <p> My name is Patricia and I am a junior in college. I have been an avid reader since I was a child. A few of my favorite genres include mystery, thriller, and historical fiction. </p>
     <p> I will be using this site as a personal library where I will give reviews of books I have read as well as recommendations based on my reviews. </p>

            <h4> The Silent Patient by Alex Michaelides </h4>
            <p> I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I read this book in one day because I just couldn't put it down. There is a huge twist that I did not see coming and the ending was perfect. The ending perfectly tied together all the elements of the story in a way that made my jaw drop. </p>
            <h3> Historical Fiction </h3>
            <h4> The Nightingale by Kristin Hannah </h4>
            <p> This book was a story about two sisters trying to find a way to survive WWII in France. This book was an amazing tear-jerker. It was beautifully written and caused so many tears, but ended in a way that I was not expecting. It's a longer book, but it's well worth the read.</p>
