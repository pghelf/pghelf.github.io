     <p> My name is Patricia and I am a junior in college. I have been an avid reader since I was a child. A few of my favorite genres include mystery, thriller, and historical fiction. </p>
     <p> I will be using this site as a personal library where I will give reviews of books I have read as well as recommendations based on my reviews. </p>

            <h4> The Silent Patient by Alex Michaelides </h4>
            <p> I give this book 5/5 stars. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I read this book in one day because I just couldn't put it down. There is a huge twist that I did not see coming and the ending was perfect. The ending perfectly tied together all the elements of the story in a way that made my jaw drop. </p>
            <h4> The Guest List by Lucy Foley</h4>
            <p> I give this book 4/5 stars. This was an amazing book. I loved the way it was written and how the chapters alternated between the present time of the story and the past parts of the story. It kept me on my toes and I felt like I was connecting clues throughout the entire book. The ending was not expected and I absolutely didn't see it coming. While I enjoyed the chapters going back and forth between the present time of the store, it also got a littel confusingat times, especially when I would come back to the story after a while of not reading it. </p>
            <h4> Verity by Colleen Hoover </h4>
            <p> I give this book 3.5/5 stars. I know there has been a lot of discussion about Colleen Hoover and after reading this book, I can see why. This is the first book I read by Colleeen Hoover. While the story was well-written, I felt like she relied too much on explicit content. The whole book felt like I was reading a crazy person's obession about their significant other and a 3rd party's attempt to try to break up a family. The book had lots of twists, but ended in a way that was somewhat expected. </p>
            
            <h3 class = "reviews-title"> Historical Fiction </h3>
            <h4> The Nightingale by Kristin Hannah </h4>
            <p> This book was a story about two sisters trying to find a way to survive WWII in France. This book was an amazing tear-jerker. It was beautifully written and caused so many tears, but ended in a way that I was not expecting. It's a longer book, but it's well worth the read. Because of Kristin Hannah's wonderful writing and story-telling, she has become one of my favorite authors.</p>

            <h3 class = "reviews-title"> Mysteries </h3>
            <h4> Where the Crawdads Sing by Delia Owens </h4>
            <p> I give this book 4.5/5 stars. I loved this book. It was wonderfully written and contained a surprise ending! I gave it 4.5 stars because I feel like the last 1-2 pages kind of ruined the story for me. I thought it was the story about a girl's triumph, and the very last pages had me left in disbelief. </p>

            <h3 class = "reviews-title"> Other Genres </h3>
            <h4> The Girl and the Goddess: Stories and Poems of Divine Wisdom by Nikita Gill </h4>
            <p> I give this book 5/5 stars! As someone who enjoys a good book of poetry every now and then, this book was amazing. There were so many poems about growing up as a girl and learnign how to face struggles women face in the world as they age. This book had great stories and I found myself tagging so many pages regarding women empowerment. </p>
            <h4> The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo by Taylor Jenkins Reid </h4>
            <p> I give this book 5/5 stars! This was the book that got me back into reading again. It was written so well and the romance aspect of the book had me tearing up at multiple parts of the story. This was a great book and she has become one of my favorite authors. </p>

            <h4> Hidden Pictures by Jason Rekulak </h4>
            <p> For upcoming thriller books, I have heard a lot from other peopel about how good this book is and how it has so many twists. This book seems to be more about supernatural occurances, so if you like supernatural stuff, I think this would be a great book for you! </p>

            <h4> Malibu Rising by Talyor Jenkins Reid </h4>
            <p> This book is very highly rated wherever you look and I'm not surprised considering how well this author can tell stories. If you liked The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo by the same author, this book is guaranteed to be another knock-out.</p>
            <h4> The Great Alone by Kristin Hannah </h4>
            <p> This book is highly recommended by almost every reader I talk to. This is another longer book, but given Kristian Hannah's amazing story-telling abilities, I can only imagine what a tear-jerker it is. </p>
